# Dictionaries, Lambda and LINQ
Collections and Queries

## Introduction

In this chapter we will learn how to use **dictionaries**, a.k.a. associative arrays, to be able to have collections of values that are not retrieved by number (like in normal arrays), but by more complex objects (e.g. strings). We will also learn about **LINQ**, a mini-language for data queries and transformations, and **lambda functions**, a way to define functions in-place, without giving them names.
