# Arrays
## Simple Array Processing
In this lecture we will learn about arrays as a way to work with sequences of elements of the same type. We will explain what arrays are, how we declare, create, instantiate and use them. We will examine one-dimensional and multidimensional arrays. We will learn different ways to iterate through the array, read from the standard input and write to the standard output. We will give many example exercises, which can be solved using arrays and we will show how useful they really are.
