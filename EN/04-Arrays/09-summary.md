# Summary
## What did we learn today?
- Arrays hold sequence of elements
    - Elements are numbered from 0 to length-1
- Creating (allocating) an array:
```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[10];
int[] nums = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
```
- Accessing array elements by index:
```csharp
numbers[5] = 10;
```
- Printing array elements:
```csharp
Console.Write(string.Join(" ", arr));
```
