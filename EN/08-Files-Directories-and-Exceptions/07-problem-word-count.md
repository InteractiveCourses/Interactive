# Problem: Word Count
- Write a program that **reads a list of words** from the file words.txt and finds **how many times** each of the words is **contained** in another file text.txt. Matching should be **case-insensitive**. Write the **results** in file results.txt. Sort the words by **frequency** in **descending** order. 




```csharp
quick is fault
```

```csharp
-I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.
-Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?
-Quick, hide hereâ€¦It is safer.
```

```csharp
is - 3
quick - 2
fault - 1
```

# Solution: Word Count
```csharp
string[] words = File.ReadAllText("words.txt").ToLower().Split();
string[] text = File.ReadAllText("input.txt").ToLower()
         .Split(new char[] {'\n','\r',' ', '.', ',', '!', '?', '-'}, 	StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

Dictionary<string, int> wordCount = new Dictionary<string, int>();

foreach (string word in words)
    wordCount[word] = 0;

foreach (string word in text)
    if (wordCount.ContainsKey(word))
         wordCount[word]++;

// Save the Output to a file
```
