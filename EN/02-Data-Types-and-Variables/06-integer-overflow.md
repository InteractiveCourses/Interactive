# Beware of Integer Overflow!
- Integers have range (minimal and maximal value)
- Integers could overflow -> this leads to incorrect values
```csharp
byte counter = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 260; i++)
{
  counter++;
  Console.WriteLine(counter);
}

```

```csharp
1
2
…
255

# Solution: Centuries to Minutes
```csharp
Console.Write("Centuries = ");
int centuries = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int years = centuries * 100;
int days = (int) (years * 365.2422); 
int hours = 24 * days;
int minutes = 60 * hours;
Console.WriteLine("{0} centuries = {1} years = {2} days = {3} hours = {4} minutes", centuries, years, days, hours, minutes);
