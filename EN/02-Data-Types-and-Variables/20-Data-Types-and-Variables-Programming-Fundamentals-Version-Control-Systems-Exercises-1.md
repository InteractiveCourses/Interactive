Upload a Few Projects at GitHub
-------------------------------

Create a few **repositories** in your **GitHub** profile and **upload a
few of your projects to GitHub**. These could be your **homework
exercises** for the last few courses, your **teamwork projects** or any
other projects that you might want to share with the developer
community. Follow these steps:

1.  First **create a remote repository** for your current project.

2. Clone it on your device:

Note that all (not paid) projects you upload at GitHub will be
**open-source** and will be accessible for **anyone** in Internet, so be
careful about passwords or code which you might **not** want to be
**visible** by **someone** else.

**Clone** some of your GitHub repositories through your **Git client**
(e.g. using the **GitBash** or **TortoiseGit**). Make some **changes**
locally, then **update** them to GitHub. Check whether the changes are
published in your GitHub profile in Internet. Follow these steps:

   1.  **Clone** again the same repository on a different place (this time use **GitBash** - *\"***git
    clone***\"*):

   2.  Return to the previous clone and it in **Windows Explorer**.

   3.  Make some **changes**:

   4.  **Commit** your local changes to your local repository.

   5.  **Push** your changes to the remote repository in GitHub:
   [image src=https://github.com/InteractiveCourses/Interactive/blob/master/assets/version-control-systems-exercises-05.png alt="version-control-systems-exercises-05.png" /]

   6.  Check whether your changes are online:
