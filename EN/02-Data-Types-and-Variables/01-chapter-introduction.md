# Data Types and Variables
Numeral Types, Text Types and Type Conversion

## Introduction
In this chapter we will examine primitive types and variables in C# – what they are and how to work with them. First we will focus on the data types – integer types, real floating-point types, Boolean, character types, strings and object types. We will continue with variables, what they and their characteristics are, how to declare them, how they are assigned a value and what variable initialization is. We will familiarize ourselves with the main categories of data types in C# – value and reference types. Finally, we will focus on literals, what they are and what kinds of literals there are.
