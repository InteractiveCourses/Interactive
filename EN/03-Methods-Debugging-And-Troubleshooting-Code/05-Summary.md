# What did we learn today?

- Break large programs into simple methods that solve small sub-problems
- Methods consist of declaration and body
- Methods are invoked by their name + `()`
- Methods can accept parameters
- Parameters take actual values when calling a method
- Methods can return a value or nothing (`void`)
- Debugging helps spotting an error more easily
